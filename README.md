# Serverpair
client server pair files
The clientfile read an xml file from the file directory and sends and sends the content of the file to the server.
The server reads the content in the xml file sent from the client and writes the content into a new xml file in the file directory.

The client algoritms sends a string input from the user to the server. The server then sends back the same userinput followed by a processed
version of the xml content in the xml file read by the client algorithm. 

That processed xml content is then saved in a text file by the client algorithm.
